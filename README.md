## Inspiration

When I was looking for how to increase my odds of getting into the Uni program I wanted to get into, I realized most data is misleading and overinflated,  This over-inflation of numbers led to anxiety and the thought that it is not possible to do.

## What it does
My application goal is to give you that confidence, to let you know that you are doing great, and it give you a perspective of where you stand and what you need to do. 

## How we built it
I first started with a rough sketch moving on to what I wanted from the software and things I wanted it to accomplish, then I moved on to balsamic, to create a rough overview.

The College Application Predicter was developed using Python, specifically FLASK and SQL, while the frontend employed HTML, CSS, and Jinja

## Challenges we ran into

The main problem we faced was getting accurate data from external sources, we also struggled to find data that was not outdated or overloaded because of bloating tactics. Even after we finished, I still feel like he could not get rid of all the wrong data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We created a user-friendly application that addresses the neverending hole of misleading data. Our website provides assessments and provides confidence and comfort. The interface is accessible and easy to navigate, showcasing our commitment to meaningful solutions.

## What we learned
One thing I think I learned was the importance of time, as it is my first hackathon, I did not realize how little 24 hours is, as a result, I struggled with time a bit and as a result did not get to sleep.

## What's next for Collage Application Predicter

For Collage Application Predicter, the ideal scenario for me is instead to use data from external sources to schools in the Bay Area (around Palo Alto) and collect data from our graduates.  This would not only help future students but it would also empower us to train our model and give students a more clear understanding.
